# huduu

“Huduu”, derived from the Arabic translation for the word “calm”, is a web application developed to help the students of the American University of Sharjah (AUS) who are experiencing difficulties with their mental health and wellbeing. This application is designed to provide these students with a platform to book, edit, and delete appointments with certified AUS counselors, track their mental health progress, as well as receive personalized tips from the counselors. The application also allows the counselors to view the appointments registered with them, as well as add personalized tips for students. This system will be modeled using the spiral model software development process model. The graphical user interface (GUI) will be designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, whereas the backend will be implemented using Flask, Python, JavaScript for the animation and progress charts, and SQLAlchemy for creating the database that will be used in order to record users’ data. Finally, the functionality of the system will be tested using Selenium IDE, and a survey will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the GUI. Maintaining a positive mental health and treating any mental health conditions is essential to stabilizing students’ behaviors and emotions, as well as enhancing their wellbeing and quality of life. Huduu aims to achieve this by ensuring quality service to AUS students in need of professional assistance.
